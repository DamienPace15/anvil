# Generate Schemas

The generate script enriches Anvil component schemas with fully-typed transform properties from upstream Pulumi providers (AWS, GCP, etc.).

## What It Does

Each Anvil component wraps one or more upstream cloud resources. Users can override properties on those resources via the `transform` map. The generate script makes those overrides fully typed by fetching the upstream provider's schema, extracting the `inputProperties` for the relevant resource, and writing them into the component's `schema.json` as typed transform types.

For example, the S3 Bucket component wraps `aws:s3/bucket:Bucket`. The script fetches the AWS provider schema, reads the bucket's input properties, and generates an `anvil:aws:BucketTransform` type so that `transform.bucket` has full autocomplete and type checking in the generated SDKs.

## How To Run

All commands run from the project root.

```bash
# Standard generate (uses cached schemas when available)
cd provider && go run ../scripts/generate/generate_schemas.go

# Or via npm from the root directory
npm run generate
```

| Flag            | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--upgrade`     | Bump all components to the latest upstream provider version |
| `--clear-cache` | Delete all cached schemas before running                    |
| `--help`        | Show usage                                                  |

## Component Schema Fields

Each component's `schema.json` (e.g. `provider/aws/bucket/schema.json`) must declare three `x-upstream-*` fields:

```json
{
  "x-upstream-provider": "aws",
  "x-upstream-token": "aws:s3/bucket:Bucket",
  "x-upstream-version": "v7.23.0",
  "resources": { ... },
  "types": {}
}
```

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-upstream-provider` | The Pulumi package name. Used for `pulumi package get-schema <provider>`. Examples: `aws`, `gcp`, `azure-native`. |
| `x-upstream-token`    | The fully-qualified Pulumi resource token for the primary resource this component wraps.                          |
| `x-upstream-version`  | The pinned upstream provider version. The script generates against this exact version.                            |

### Adding a New Component

1. Create `provider/<cloud>/<resource>/schema.json` with the three `x-upstream-*` fields, your `resources` definition, and an empty `types: {}`.
2. Create the Go component file alongside it.
3. Run `npm run build`. The script auto-discovers the new component and enriches its schema.

## How It Works

### 1. Auto-Discovery

The script scans all subdirectories under `provider/` (skipping `cmd`, `scripts`, `sdk`) looking for `<cloud>/<resource>/schema.json` files. No registration needed — drop in a folder and it's picked up.

### 2. Version Detection

For each unique `x-upstream-provider` found across all components, the script detects the latest available version via `pulumi package get-schema <provider>`. The latest version is cached in `.cache/upstream-schemas/<provider>-latest-version.txt` for 24 hours.

### 3. Version Pinning

Each component pins to a specific upstream version via `x-upstream-version`. The script always generates against the pinned version, not latest. This prevents unexpected schema changes from breaking your builds.

Version warnings:

- **Minor/patch drift** (e.g. `v7.22.0` → `v7.23.0`): quiet info line, no warning.
- **Major drift** (e.g. `v7.23.0` → `v8.0.0`): loud warning suggesting you review breaking changes.

Use `--upgrade` to bump all components to latest.

### 4. Schema Fetching & Trimmed Caching

Upstream provider schemas are large (~47MB for AWS). The script never stores the full schema on disk. Instead:

1. Fetches the full schema into memory via `pulumi package get-schema <provider>@<version>`.
2. Extracts only the resources and types needed by the current component.
3. Recursively follows `$ref` chains to include all referenced types.
4. Writes a trimmed cache file to `.cache/upstream-schemas/<provider>-<version>-trimmed.json`.

On subsequent runs, the trimmed cache is loaded directly — typically a few hundred KB instead of 47MB, loading in milliseconds.

If multiple components use the same provider@version (e.g. `aws/bucket` and `aws/lambda` both on `aws@v7.23.0`), the cache merges their tokens together. The second component adds its tokens to the existing cache rather than replacing it.

### 5. Deprecation Replacement

Some upstream resources have deprecated inline properties that were replaced by standalone resources (common in AWS). For example, the S3 bucket's `versioning` property is deprecated in favour of `aws:s3/bucketVersioningV2:BucketVersioningV2`.

The script detects these by scanning `deprecationMessage` fields for references to replacement resources, then generates typed transform types for the replacements. This is fully generic — it works for any provider that follows this pattern.

### 6. Provider-Specific Companions

Some companion resources can't be discovered through deprecation messages. These are hardcoded in the `addProviderSpecificTransforms` function. Currently:

- **AWS S3 Bucket** → `BucketPublicAccessBlock` (added as `publicAccessBlock` transform key)

The companion tokens are also declared in `getCompanionTokens` so they're included in the trimmed cache.

### 7. Cache Pruning

At the end of every run, the script deletes any cache files that don't correspond to a provider@version currently used by any component. This keeps the cache directory clean after version upgrades.

### 8. Legacy Migration

Schemas using the old `x-aws-token` / `x-aws-version` fields are automatically migrated to the generic `x-upstream-provider` / `x-upstream-token` / `x-upstream-version` fields on first run.

## Cache Directory

```
.cache/upstream-schemas/
├── aws-latest-version.txt          # "v7.23.0" — refreshed every 24h
├── aws-v7.23.0-trimmed.json        # Trimmed schema with only used resources/types
├── gcp-latest-version.txt          # "v9.15.0"
└── gcp-v9.15.0-trimmed.json        # Trimmed schema
```

Add `.cache/` to your `.gitignore`.
