"""Forward references for Anvil programs (Approach A — deferred-lookup refs).

Hand-written. Backed up/restored during gen-sdk like app.py, block.py, types.py,
grants.py.

Resources construct eagerly, as they always have. A Stack registry maps each
resource's logical id to the constructed object, and ``ctx.ref('id')`` hands back
a handle whose attribute access yields a pulumi.Output that resolves once that id
is registered — which may happen *later* in the same synchronous ``run()``,
letting resources be declared in any order.

Because a ref resolves (at deploy time, after ``run()`` has fully executed) to the
resource's *real* Output, Pulumi's dependency tracking, ordering, and cycle
detection all work unchanged. After ``run()`` returns, the App calls ``validate()``
to turn any never-declared reference into a clean error instead of a silent miss.

See docs/design/forward-references.md for the full design.
